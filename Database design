**Databases and Tables for Carbon Equity Tracker**  

The Carbon Equity Tracker uses three separate databases to organize information efficiently. Each database has specific tables to store and manage related data.  

---

### **1️⃣ Database: `cet_login`**  
- **Purpose:** Handles user authentication by securely storing login credentials.  
- **Table:**  
  - **`Logincred`**  
    - **username**: A unique name for each user (Primary Key).  
    - **password**: The user’s password, stored securely.  

---

### **2️⃣ Database: `cet_user`**  
- **Purpose:** Stores individual user data, including their daily activities and carbon footprint.  
- **Table:**  
  - **`User_data`**  
    - **user_id**: A unique identifier for each user (Primary Key).  
    - **daily_commute**: Distance the user travels daily (in kilometers).  
    - **waste_generated**: Amount of waste generated daily (in kg).  
    - **country**: The user's country (to calculate region-specific emissions).  
    - **total_emissions**: The user’s calculated carbon footprint.  

---

### **3️⃣ Database: `cet_industry`**  
- **Purpose:** Stores industrial data to calculate emissions for businesses.  
- **Table:**  
  - **`Industry_data`**  
    - **industry_id**: A unique identifier for each industry (Primary Key).  
    - **energy_consumed**: Total energy used (in kilowatt-hours).  
    - **materials_used**: Raw materials consumed (in tons).  
    - **total_emissions**: The calculated carbon footprint for the industry.  

---

### **Key Features of the Design**  
- **Logical Separation:** Data is grouped into separate databases for clarity and better management.  
- **Secure Relationships:** Foreign keys ensure data connections, e.g., linking `user_id` in `cet_user` with `username` in `cet_login`.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Indexes are used to speed up data retrieval for common queries.

This structure ensures secure, fast, and reliable data handling, making carbon tracking efficient and user-friendly.
