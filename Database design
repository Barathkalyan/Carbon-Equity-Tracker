### 📂 **Database Structure**  

#### 1️⃣ **Logincred Table** (Located in `cet_login` Database)  
- **Purpose:** Stores user credentials to manage authentication securely.  
- **Columns:**  
  - `username` (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for users.  
  - `password` – Securely stores hashed passwords.  

#### 2️⃣ **User_data Table** (Located in `cet_user` Database)  
- **Purpose:** Captures individual users’ data and emissions records.  
- **Columns:**  
  - `user_id` (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for each user.  
  - `daily_commute` – Distance traveled by the user in kilometers.  
  - `waste_generated` – Amount of waste generated (in kg).  
  - `country` – User’s country for localized emission factors.  
  - `total_emissions` – Calculated carbon emissions for the user.  

#### 3️⃣ **Industry_data Table** (Located in `cet_industry` Database)  
- **Purpose:** Manages data related to industrial emissions.  
- **Columns:**  
  - `industry_id` (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for industries.  
  - `energy_consumed` – Energy usage (in kWh).  
  - `materials_used` – Raw materials consumed (in tons).  
  - `total_emissions` – Calculated industrial carbon emissions.  

---

### 🔗 **Relationships**  
- **Foreign Keys:** Ensure referential integrity between tables. For instance:  
  - `user_id` in `User_data` references `username` in `Logincred`.  
  - `industry_id` in `Industry_data` links to its corresponding login in `Logincred`.  

---

### 🛠️ **Optimization Features**  
- **Indexes:** Improve query performance for frequently accessed columns like `username`, `user_id`, and `industry_id`.  
- **Data Validation:** Ensures valid inputs to maintain data consistency (e.g., no negative commute distances).  

---

### 🔒 **Security Measures**  
- Implements **hashing algorithms** for storing passwords securely.  
- Uses role-based access control to restrict unauthorized database access.
